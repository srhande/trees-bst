# PA8 BST
1. PA Name: Binary Search Trees <br>
2. Description: In this PA, we implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure and utilized it to store the population data of cities. <br>
3. Features: I implemented Node.java to define the node data strcture that serves as the building blocks for the BST. Each holds a city and a population value. Then I implemented BinarySearchTree.java which is where we implement the actual BST and its associated methods and operations. There is also a tester file where we create tests, titled StudentTester.java. <br>

5. Acknowledgements: I used the help of Piazza, and also referred to the internet to thoroughly understand the binary search tree. However, what was most helpful was mostly likely the different subsections in the PA writeup itself as it told us how to implement the methods how the writeup intended us to implement them.
