# Binary Search Trees <br>
Description: I implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure and utilized it to store the population data of cities. <br>
I implemented Node.java to define the node data strcture that serves as the building blocks for the BST. Each holds a city and a population value. Then I implemented BinarySearchTree.java which is where I implement the actual BST and its associated methods and operations. There is also a tester file where I created tests, titled StudentTester.java. <br>
